NEVER RUN `cargo clean`, it wipes out caches and takes forever to rebuild.

ALWAYS check for lint errors with `cargo clippy` when you're done and address them before moving on.
Never run the game without checking clippy first.

When making changes to the game, always verify your changes with at least these steps:
1. Make sure game isn't already running
2. Run the game (fork to background), log to a file
3. Wait a few seconds for the game to start
4. Checks the logs for any issues
5. Screenshot the game window and inspect against changes
6. Send keyboard input to the game (as needed)
7. (Optional) Repeat 3-4 to keep testing the game to verify behavior

You should use a combination of the screenshots, keyboard input, and logging to verify the behavior.
